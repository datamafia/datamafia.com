                            I am a Python developer focusing mostly on Django, business logic,
                            APIs, and 'vanilla'. I leverage over 16 years experience as a
                            developer (full-stack/back-end), produce high quality code, and deliver
                            long shelf life products where SDLC matters. I prefer to work in Python but
                            do make exceptions for small teams as my experience, language count, and rapid
                            skill acquisition delivers unparalleled value. Considerable leadership
                            experience included, but I chase knowledge over titles knowing that I need to code to be happy.

                            Most of my down time is spent doing R&D or learning

                                From this work we published an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) script. Using this Python

                                No, this is not link bait. In 2013 I was contracted to build a prototype of the same basic app for
                                an organization quite similar to the RNC.  The application worked, scraped Facebook data when authorized, ran copious math
                                against the data, and created suggestions per a library of algorithms chosen and used on the fly. Unlike others, I
                                followed the rules such as expiring data, created safeguards against TOS violations, and resisted the urge to
                                normalize data (commingling). The success of the application and the underlying suggestion engine was enough for me to leave
                                Facebook and redesign the footprint I leave on the web.
